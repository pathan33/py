Repository to store sample Python programs.

This repository is meant for beginners to assist them in their learning of Python. The repository covers a wide range of algorithms and other programs, and would prove immensely helpful for everybody interested in Python programming.

Also, this repository will be surely helpful for all the DataScience aspirants for laying their strong foundation in concepts such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

If this is your first time coding in Python, I would love to suggest you begin from the [Basics](https://github.com/pathan33/py/tree/master/Basics). They are simple to understand and hopefully will prove fun to you. 

Contributions to the repository are welcome.
